	<p>Thank you for your participation in our study!  Your anonymous data makes an important contribution to our understanding of decision making. </p>

      <p>The purpose of this study was to invesigate a phenomenon called sunk cost effect, the tendency of people to continue a certain behavior they have previously invested considerable resources in even if there is no more value in this particular course of action. Given that people have been shown to treat mental effort as costly, we aimed to test whether exerting cognitive control for a potential reward would also elicit a sunk cost effect. </p>

    <p>In this study, we hypothesized that participants invest significantly more often in projects with lower difficulty and higher success probability. Importantly, we expect that in case of a second investment, the likelihood of investing in a rather unattractive project (i.e., high difficulty and relatively low success probability) would increase compared to trials with no prior investment. This sunk cost effect should be particularly strong if the initial effort investment was high.  </p>
